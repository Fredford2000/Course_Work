ESSAY: 

What is program data?
What is program flow?
Define "method', "routine", "argument", "return value" and "function" in your own words.

Refers to the instructions that make up a program that are really just data stored in binary just like all other data in a computer.

It's the order that the instructions in a program are executed.

Method, routine, and function are different names for a list of instructions in a program stored in memory that are called by a plain English name. 
An argument is data given to a function so it can complete it's task and a return value is data the function gives back to the program.
