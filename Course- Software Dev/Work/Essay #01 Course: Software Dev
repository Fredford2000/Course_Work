Algorithmic thinking is clearly defining the steps needed to find a solution to something.

If I had a list or receipts you each month of the year that were sorted by date and I wanted them sorted by price, I could use a merge sort to do that. 
If I had a list of friends that was sorted by age and I wanted it sorted alphabetically, I could use an insert sort or a selection sort to do that.
