ESSAY:

What are five of the most common command line commands?
What do they each do?
How is it useful for you to know about the command line as a developer?

cd: Used to swich directories.

dir: Used to list directories and files in current directory.

del: Used to delete files.

move: Used to move files between directories.

ren: Used to rename files and directories.

The command line is useful for me to understand as a developer because it can be move efficient at manipulating files and directories, especially when working with large amounts of them.
