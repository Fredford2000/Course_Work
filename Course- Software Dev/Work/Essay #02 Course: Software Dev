Class: A definition of potential property and behaviors.

Object: It's an actual virtual "object/thing" of the potential property and behaviors described by it's class.

Instance: It's a exact copy of an object.

Constructor: Described behavior in a class for making an object of that class.

State/Stateless: State is something that changes over time and stateless is something that stays the same.

Encapsulation: A function or some code who's inner workings are hidden from the rest of the program so the program doesn't mess up the variables and such within that code.

Inheritance: A parent/child relationship in programming where the child program gains(inherits) all the properties and behaviors of the parent class.

Composition/Aggregation: Composition is when a class is used in another class. Aggregation is when a class exists independently of other classes.

Polymorphism: The rules for how parent/child classes work in your program.

Index: Data that is used to find specific data in a bigger set of data.

Loop: Code that repeats over and over again until some condition is meet.
