Turn this write up in to your Instructor.

  In the previous video and though out this course I learned that the actual writing of code makes up just a portion an average 
programmers day. I learned that communication and teamwork are a big part of it and are equally if not more important than writing
code. I also know that though out this course and my carrier I'm going to run into problems that make me want to bang
my head against a wall, but I just need to learn how to break those problems into small workable steps and not be afraid to search 
online for the information I need.Over all I think this course taught me what to expect in my carrier and set me on a good path to 
build up my network connections.
