ESSAY: 

What is a programming language?
Why are there different types?
How do programming languages work with data?

A programming language is a set of instructions that gets turned into machine code for the computer to follow.

There are different types of programming languages to meet the preferences of different software developers and because different programming languages are better geared towards/for certain tasks or aspects of software development.

The type of data has specified to the computer by the programmer so the computer knows how to use it.
