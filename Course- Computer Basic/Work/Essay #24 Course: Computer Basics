ESSAY:

Why is asynchronous useful?
What is an array and how is it used?
What are some of the ways one can connect to the internet?
What did you learn from watching the "Computer Basics Video 1" and "Computer Basics Video 2"?

Because it allows computers to multitask instead of getting stuck waiting on data.

It's an organized group of data in a sequence that can make it easier to organized, store, and manipulate grouped data.

You could connect to the internet via: phone-lines, satellite, or fiber optics.

I got a little refresher on a lot of the concepts I learned throughout the Computer Basics Course. Like the difference between analog and digital, how transistors work, etc.
