ESSAY: 

How is a computer basically composed?
How does a computer work?
How are numbers stored, added and handled by a computer?
Why is it useful for you to know how a computer works as a developer?
What did you learn from doing this section of the course?

A computer is basically composed of storage of data and instructions and a processes to process the instructions. 

A computer needs many things to work properly. A CPU to process instructions and execute them, a hard drive for permanent storage when the computer is off, RAM for quick access to stored data when processing data, a motherboard to connect all the parts, input devices to get input from the user, output devices to give information to the user.

Numbers are stored in RAM, added in the ALU within the CPU, and handled by the CPU with the instructions it gets from RAM.

It will help me understand the limits of programming, help me better understand what computer functions are doing within the computer and what problems may arise.

I learned how the CPU uses registries, the bus, the ALU, and RAM to process basic instructions and execute them.
