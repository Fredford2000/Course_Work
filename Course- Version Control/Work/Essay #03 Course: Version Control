FINAL ESSAY:

What is version control? 
How does Distributed Version Control differ from Centralized Version Control? 
What benefits are there in understanding Git, GitHub and version control in general? 
How can you use these tools as a software developer? 

Version control is software used to save a history of changes made to your files by you and others. 
In distributed version control everyone has their own copy of the repository that they have to update 
as changes are made while in centralized version control the repository is in one place and files are 
checkout so by people to work on. Knowing how to use these tools will help me fix errors or revert to 
older versions if I have to and will make working with other people much better.
