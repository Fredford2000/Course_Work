ESSAY: 

What is Git? 
What is GitHub? 
How can you use these tools as a software developer? 

Git is a free open source version control software.

Github is a repository hosting service for git with features to help with team management and open source projects.

I can use both of these tools together to help me with version control and for working with teams of developers.
